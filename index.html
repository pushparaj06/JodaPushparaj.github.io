                <P>Hi There! I am a computer science student with a passion for full-stack web development. I love building dynamic and interactive web applications that engage users and solve real-world problems.

                    In my studies, I have developed expertise in both front-end and back-end technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and databases such as MongoDB and MySQL. I am also familiar with various software development methodologies and tools, such as Agile, Git, and AWS.
                    
                    My goal as a full-stack developer is to create seamless and efficient web applications that meet the needs of users and businesses alike. In this portfolio, you will find examples of my work in full-stack web development, including projects that showcase my skills in both front-end and back-end development.
